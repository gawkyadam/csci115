    <div class="paragraph">RAM stands for random access memory, and it's one of the most fundamental elements of computing. RAM is a temporary memory bank where your computer
         stores data it needs to retrieve quickly. RAM keeps data easily accessible so your processor can quickly find it without having to go into long-term storage to complete immediate processing tasks.
         To understand RAM, let’s use the analogy of a physical desk. Your working space is the top of the desk. That’s where you keep everything you frequently use within arm’s reach, so you won’t 
         waste time searching through your drawers. By contrast, anything you don’t use that much or that you want to save for later goes into a desk drawer.
         On your computer, your RAM is like the top of your desk, where you keep everything you need quick access to. And the data that you don’t use much or want to save for later is stored on a hard disk, either locally in your device or in the cloud.
