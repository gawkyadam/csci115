    <div style="margin-right: 100px;" class="paragraph">The GPU is the most important part for good quality display, especially for gaming. They are designed to accelerate graphics rendering. The software applications, in conjunction with the CPU, sends 
        information about the image to the graphics card. The graphics card decides how to use the pixels on the screen to create the image. It then sends that information to the monitor through a cable.
        Creating an image out of binary data is a demanding process. To make a 3-D image, the graphics card first creates a wire frame out of straight lines. Then, it rasterizes the image (fills in the remaining pixels).
         It also adds lighting, texture and color. For fast-paced games, the computer has to go through this process about 60 to 120 times per second. Without a graphics card to perform the necessary calculations, the workload
          would be too much for the computer to handle.<br>To learn more about the science of GPU's click<a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/graphics-card.htm" target="_blank"> here.</a></div>
